Thanks for the clarification. Here's a more complete `README.md` that includes **features** of a typical Laravel package scaffold and instructions on **how to use it with Laravel**:

# my-package

A Laravel package scaffolding tool designed to speed up package development with Laravel support.

## âœ¨ Features

- Laravel package auto-discovery support
- PSR-4 autoloading for `src` and `tests` directories
- Service Provider and optional Facade auto-registration
- Composer-based package structure
- Directory structure for:
  - Config files
  - Migrations
  - Views
  - Routes
  - Tests
- Supports Laravel 8, 9, and 10
- PHPUnit and Orchestra Testbench for easy package testing
- `dev` stability with `prefer-stable` enabled

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

First, create your package using the scaffold script:

```bash
bash create-package.sh
```

> This will create a folder named `my-package` (or your custom package name) with all boilerplate files.

Then inside your Laravel app, require the local package:

```bash
composer require your-vendor/my-package:@dev
```

If you're testing it locally, use the path option:

```bash
composer require your-vendor/my-package:@dev --prefer-source
```

Or add it to `composer.json` manually:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "../my-package"
    }
],
"require": {
    "your-vendor/my-package": "@dev"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
composer update
```

## ðŸ›  Usage in Laravel

If you're using Laravel 5.5+ the package will be auto-discovered.

Otherwise, manually register:

### Add the Service Provider

```php
// config/app.php

'providers' => [
    YourVendor\MyPackage\MyPackageServiceProvider::class,
],
```

### Add the Facade (optional)

```php
// config/app.php

'aliases' => [
    'MyPackage' => YourVendor\MyPackage\Facades\MyPackage::class,
],
```

### Publish Config (if applicable)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=my-package-config
```

### Example Usage

```php
use MyPackage;

MyPackage::doSomethingCool();
```

## âœ… Testing

Run tests via PHPUnit:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## ðŸ§± Folder Structure

```
my-package/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Main package source code
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ database/migrations/    # Package migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/views/        # Blade views
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/                 # Custom package routes
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Unit and feature tests
â””â”€â”€ composer.json           # Package metadata
```
